# This is lab of ICS-2020

>2020.1.26

i have to writing this log in english, even if it's really poor, because input process crashed in experiment environment which is conducted on linux ubuntu-1804.
i stuck with shell lab which is really hard at least to me. 

>2020.2.3

i was really stuck with trace08 for a few days. there exists lots of problem in waitfg() need to take patience. one thing needs to be noticed is set blocking mask correctly before you do anything.
blocking mask was not setting correctly what makes trace08 always failed.

JUST DO IT and don't stop on thinking about why my solution on waitfg is diff with others.
